Vulnerability Scanner
The Vulnerability Scanner is a Python-based tool that scans a given IP address or range of IP addresses for open ports and services. It pulls real-time vulnerability data from multiple sources, detects common service misconfigurations, sends real-time email notifications for critical findings, and visualizes the network scan results.

Key Features:
Multiple Vulnerability Sources: Retrieves vulnerabilities from multiple databases, including:
National Vulnerability Database (NVD)
CVE Details
Exploit-DB
Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV)
Misconfiguration Detection: Detects common misconfigurations in services, such as:
Default credentials
Exposed services
Weak encryption
Real-Time Email Notifications: Sends immediate email notifications when critical vulnerabilities are found.
Network Visualization: Generates a visual map of the network, showing detected services and vulnerabilities.
Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
Log Files: Saves scan results and vulnerabilities to log files for review.
Requirements:
Python 3.x
nmap installed on your system
python-nmap, requests, smtplib, and graphviz libraries (automatically installed by the script)
How to Run:
Install Nmap:

Linux/macOS:
sudo apt install nmap   # On Debian-based systems
brew install nmap       # On macOS (using Homebrew)
Windows: Download and install Nmap from nmap.org.
Download the script and save it as vulnerability_scanner.py.

Run the script:

Linux/macOS:
sudo python3 vulnerability_scanner.py
Windows:
python vulnerability_scanner.py
The script will automatically install any missing dependencies and begin the scan.

Real-Time Notifications:
Email Notifications: Critical vulnerabilities detected during the scan will trigger real-time email notifications. By default, these notifications are sent to xelitegaming2004@gmail.com. You can change this email address in the script if needed.
Network Visualization:
After the scan, the tool generates a network map that visually displays the scanned IP addresses, services, and any vulnerabilities found.
The visualization is created using Graphviz and saved as a .gv file.
Example Usage:
bash
Copy code
python3 vulnerability_scanner.py

The scanner will prompt for the target IP address and scan type (default, aggressive, UDP, etc.).
The results will be displayed in the terminal and saved to log files.
An email notification will be sent for any critical vulnerabilities.
Configuration:
Email Settings: You can customize the sender, recipient, and SMTP server settings directly in the script.
Misconfiguration Rules: The script checks for common misconfigurations like exposed services or default credentials. You can extend these checks by adding custom rules.
Log Files:
Scan results are saved in log files named vulnerability_scan_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.log for later review.
Each log file contains a detailed list of the open ports, services, vulnerabilities, CVSS scores, and any misconfigurations detected.
